### About me

I'm a 26-year-old from Italy and I started teaching myself programming at 18. Now I'm taking a course at [DCI Digital Career Institute](https://digitalcareerinstitute.org/) to become a professional.

On my free time I knit sweaters and read a bunch.

### Work

I'm interested in lots of different fields, namely **research**, **data science**, **web development** and **video game development**.

### Programming

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- basics of C++
- basics of Python
- git & GitHub
